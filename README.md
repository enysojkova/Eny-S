hi stranger, this is camera-shy me, but in real life I concider myself to be pretty outgoing and talkative

### let me tell you a little more about myself: 
- I'm currently studying and trying my best to become a proffesional brand designer
- at the moment I'm based in the Czech Republic, but I'm very open to online and remote work connections
- beside design (of any kind) I very much enjoy the mountains - in all seasons, any cultural events and travelling
