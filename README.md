### my design journey
I could say, I dedicated my whole life to art and music. At least since I was able to hold a pencil, talk and dance. So when it was time to choose a career path (at the end of high school), it was quite obvious, that I would go the "artsy" way. 

While looking through my options, I tried to be as practical as possible. Classical art wasn't gonna cut it, because I always knew I'd need a well paid job with home office options. The reason was travelling and the fact, that half of my family lives in Central America. My dream is, to get to know this part of the world better and stay there for a while, since it's so close to my heart. 

I started researching design schools - interior, graphic, product or furniture design. To be honest, I immediately fell in love with the idea of becoming a graphic designer. 

My dear friend showed me all the required programmes and helped me create a portfolio. And so my design journey began. 


### in my free-time  
When it comes to work, I can seem very calculating. Or at least when I chose my career path. In my personal life, I don't know what I'm doing half the time, not to mention my terrible memory. I prefer to say I'm spontaneous or distracted, my friends think I'm prematurely senile. 

All jokes aside, in case it's raining i don't mind spending the day indoors drawing/painting. Or being out in the best company - my dear friends. An everyday must-do is walking my dog. Preferably in the mountains or woods near my town. 

I'm a big theatre fan - movie, performance, ballet, drama. My passion is definitely music. To me, summer means the big stage concerts or tiny acoustic nights in local caf√©s. 

I'd say travelling must be in my DNA. My parents and my grandparents travelled half the world. Me and my brother seem to be following their footsteps for now. Although he's more into waves and surfing, whereas I lean towards the mountains and skiing.

#### Art school 
I joined "ZU≈† Chomutov" at the age of 6 to study art education. Here I had the opportunity to try many artistic techniques from ceramics to lithography. Theory was also part of the teaching - perspective, golden ratio, drawing from angles. 

#### University V≈†KK (cz), PSCC (eng) 
At the Prague School of Creative Communication I was taught by professionals in the field. The main subjects were, for example, history of art and design, typography or also marketing and philosophy. The school connected us with many interesting clients and commissions (Czech Post, Kobe Restaurants or the town of ≈†pindler≈Øv ml√Ωn).

#### Kobe Gastro Group
The cooperation with Kobe was facilitated by the school. Kobe Restaurants approached the university to rebrand their existing restaurants and create a new company, Kobe Gastro Group. Kobe GG will be the parent company that will be the umbrella for their 4 restaurants. It will also be used for day to day communication with clients and suppliers. 


10 teams created proposals that were judged in 2 rounds. Our team made it to the finals and ended up winning first place and continues to work with the client. 


Our work included 2 facelifts of existing logos. 2 designs for new logos and communication styles. The last one was brand manuals. 


My role in this project: team leader, sketches of all facelifts and new logos.

#### PAVA Dental Lab 
It's important to emphasize that this is not a dental practice, but only a laboratory that supplies dentists with implants, etc. 

My job was to create a logo and design the application on business cards and t-shirts.

# 3. ü™ë Skip to the good stuff - Case study
### Memisto




- my dream client: small and/or personal business, preferably local projects, I tend to have a very personal approach - getting along with my client is essential
- ideal projects: branding, logo manuals, visual identity, design drafts and brand brainstorming





# 4. üéôÔ∏è Voice & tone 
I try not to make a big difference between my professional and personal life. I like to work on projects where it is very important for me to show my character to the client. It seems to me that sometimes my strong character can show in the result. That is why I prefer a personal, warm and sincere approach - the client can know what to expect. In my personal life, I logically choose the same approach and most of all I prefer to be truthful and helpful.
