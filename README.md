hi stranger, this is camera-shy me, but in real life I concider myself to be pretty outgoing and talkative


## 💁🏻‍♀️ let me tell you a little more about myself: 
- I'm currently studying and working towards becoming a proffesional brand designer
- at the moment I'm based in the Czech Republic, but I'm very open to online and remote work connections
- beside design (of any kind) I enjoy the mountains - in all seasons, any cultural events and travelling


## 💻 let's take a look at my work:
- my dream client: small and/or personal business, preferably local projects, I tend to have a very personal approach - getting along with my client 
- ideal projects: branding, logo manuals, visual identity, design drafts and brand brainstorming
