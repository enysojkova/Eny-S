### my design journey
I could say, I dedicated my whole life to art and music. At least since I was able to hold a pencil, talk and dance. So when it was time to choose a career path (at the end of high school), it was quite obvious, that I would go the "artsy" way. 

While looking through my options, I tried to be as practical as possible. Classical art wasn't gonna cut it, because I always knew I'd need a well paid job with home office options. The reason was travelling and the fact, that half of my family lives in Central America. My dream is, to get to know this part of the world better and stay there for a while, since it's so close to my heart. 

I started researching design schools - interior, graphic, product or furniture design. To be honest, I immediately fell in love with the idea of becoming a graphic designer. 

My dear friend showed me all the required programs and helped me create a portfolio. And so my design journey began. 

&nbsp;

### in my free-time  
When it comes to work, I can seem very calculating. Or at least when I chose my career path. In my personal life, I don't know what I'm doing half the time, not to mention my terrible memory. I prefer to say I'm spontaneous or distracted, my friends think I'm prematurely senile. 

All jokes aside, in case it's raining I don't mind spending the day indoors drawing/painting. Or being out in the best company - my dear friends. An everyday must-do is walking my dog. Preferably in the mountains or woods near my town. 

I'm a big theatre fan - movie, performance, ballet, drama. My passion is definitely music. To me, summer means the big stage concerts or tiny acoustic nights in local caf√©s. 

I'd say travelling must be in my DNA. My parents and my grandparents travelled half the world. Me and my brother seem to be following their footsteps for now. Although he's more into waves and surfing, whereas I lean towards the mountains and skiing.

&nbsp;

#### Art school - 2006-20
I joined "ZU≈† Chomutov" at the age of 6 to study art education. Here I had the opportunity to try many artistic techniques from ceramics to lithography. Theory was also part of the teaching - perspective, golden ratio, drawing from angles. 

&nbsp;

#### University V≈†KK (cz), PSCC (eng) - 2020-23
At the Prague School of Creative Communication I was taught by professionals in the field. The main subjects were, for example, history of art and design, typography or also marketing and philosophy. The school connected us with many interesting clients and commissions (Czech Post, Kobe Restaurants or the town of ≈†pindler≈Øv ml√Ωn).

&nbsp;

#### Kobe Gastro Group - 2021-22
The cooperation with Kobe was facilitated by the school. Kobe Restaurants approached the university to rebrand their existing restaurants and create a new company, Kobe Gastro Group. Kobe GG will be the parent company that will be the umbrella for their 4 restaurants. It will also be used for day to day communication with clients and suppliers. 


10 teams created proposals that were judged in 2 rounds. Our team made it to the finals and ended up winning first place and continues to work with the client. 


Our work included 2 facelifts of existing logos. 2 designs for new logos and communication styles. The last one was brand manuals. 


My role in this project: team leader, sketches of all facelifts and new logos.

&nbsp;

#### PAVA Dental Lab - 2022
It's important to emphasize that this is not a dental practice, but only a laboratory that supplies dentists with implants, etc. 

My job was to create a logo and design the application on business cards and t-shirts. 

&nbsp;

#### Customised by Ji≈ô√≠ Dvo≈ô√°ƒçek - 2022
The client makes his own watch straps and wallets from genuine leather. He processes the leather himself and stamps his logo on the products - which I designed and processed. 

&nbsp;

#### Kimono design - 2022
2 Complete designs of names and sponsors on the back and their logo on the front. For 2 young athletes (Brazilian jiu-jitsu) performing at world level. 

&nbsp;

#### Nahota ≈æivota (transl. The Nudity of Life) - 2022-23
2nd collection of my dear friend's poems. My job is to create the cover and design the layout of the text in the book, choosing the fonts and creating additional illustrations. 

&nbsp;

#### Memisto - 2022-23
Memisto is an online shop offering luxury furniture from Europe. Lamps, chandeliers, armchairs, chairs, writing and dining tables, coffee tables or storage furniture. My task was to come up with a name in addition to the usual branding (logo, pattern, font, colours). I also designed the look of the website and the design for social media communication. 

&nbsp;

#### Lior - 2023
Czech manufacturer of luminaires with a wide range of chromaticity and the possibility of changing RGB colours. The main idea is healthy, smart lighting. Due to the exceptional design and high price this project is very interesting. 
Due to time pressure I was forced to part with the project in the middle. This means that my part only included creating the name, moodboard and designing the communication. However, the owners continue to work with some of my designs and ideas.  


&nbsp;

# [3. ü™ë Skip to the good stuff - Memisto Case study](favorite-work-case-study.md)
### Memisto

> ### Summary

> sorry, I'm not giving you the summary, this one's worth your while 

&nbsp;

__A. Challenge__ 

Memisto is a newly created brand. The goal is to get statement, high quality furniture to modern households/apartments. 

Thankfully my client did his research. He found out, that people who could afford such homes, would prefer professionals to arrange said space. That is why our end customer is most likely to be an interior designer = B2B communication. 

My assignment was to create the:
- brand name 
- moodboard 
- logo 
- color palette 
- pattern 
- e commerce preview 
- Instagram templates 

&nbsp;

__B. Solution__ 

After researching the competition, inspiration and foreign brands I made a project proposal. 

We'll create a name that subtly plays with words but is easy to pronounce (in eng/cz). Something funky but memorable. Most of the furniture my client would like to sell looks very round and soft. We will enhance that with light and calming colours. To add some contrast and character, I'll add sharper shapes and patterns. Here I'd like to remind you, that we are already targeting designers! The outcome can look more expensive and little bit out of reach. E commerce needs to be very easy to navigate. Socials should feel very timeless, not too trendy, but still active. 

Key words: timeless, statement, clouds, cosy

&nbsp;

__C. Result__ 

Memisto in czech, when broken apart, means "m√© m√≠sto" = "my place". You can see it, but it's not too obvious. (This took much longer than expected, since I had nothing from the client to hold onto). Other ideas were for example Mialgo, Tonas or Kalma.. After checking .com availability and memorability, Memisto was the winner. 

The typography was very easy to choose, since we knew from the beginning the vibe it should have. Logo and the 3 dots came naturally‚Ä¶ The feel of wanting more, of something unsaid. Straight up our alley! 

Than we have the checker board. Chess is one of the oldest and most sophisticated games I can think of. But changing the black to a muted brown makes all the difference. And when I added the round, beautiful, sometimes pastel furniture, it all made sense. 

E commerce has a blend of beauty and simplicity (cheesy, right?). But that's all we need, let the products speak for themselves. No games, no fuss. 

This project is still in progres and I can't wait to share the final results!

It's been one of the most beautiful and relaxing branding rides I've been on. These are the projects that fuel my creativity and will to keep working.

# [4. üéôÔ∏è voice & tone](voice-and-tone.md)
> ### Summary

>  - Voice: core values: honesty, truth, warmth, respect and friendliness
>  - Tone: respect, polite, fuunny

&nbsp;

### Voice 
To me, voice feels very natural, it's who I am. I believe it can be changed, but it would be challenge. Maybe I can care for it? Give it some sort of direction, guidelines, carefully watch it? And look for possible mistakes. My core values are honesty, truth, warmth, respect and friendliness. The audience I'm trying to attract is younger (25-40 y. o.). Generally interested in design or aesthetics. 

### Tone
Tone is something I choose, it's variable, the flavour to my voice, the song I decide to sing. I'm very particular about getting along with my clients (and friends). The indicator is usually the way they we critique and give opinions. I intend to express myself in a kind and honest way. When I'm about to say something negative, I always avoid being rude and instead use politeness. That's not to be confused with sugar coating. When it's possible and welcomed I like to lighten up the mood with something funny and light. 

### Client
In two words - mutual respect. The best example is the "negative comment" approach. Since my clients have to review my work and give feedback.. "always avoid being rude and instead use politeness. That's not to be confused with sugar coating."
- my dream client: small and/or personal business, preferably local projects, I tend to have a very personal approach - getting along with my client is essential
- ideal projects: branding, logo manuals, visual identity, design drafts and brand brainstorming

### Abstract 
#### 1st draft
This bachelor's thesis deals with the creation of a complex identity for the sports and recreational facility Bar & Grill Adventure Golf Kamencov√© jezero. An important part of this is the design of a social media marketing strategy along with a manual for the owners who wish to manage their content across all platforms themselves. The adventure golf playground was built in 2022 on the site of a former mini golf course, it should be noted that they are not the same discipline. This fact needs to be explained and emphasized through the visual identity not only to the readers of this work, but also to the residents of Chomutov (where the complex is located) and other potential visitors.

keywords: visual identity, adventure golf, logo design, restaurant branding, design

#### 2nd draft
I dedicated my thesis to the visual identity for Adventure Golf Kamencov√© jezero in Chomutov. The minigolf-like playground was built in 2022 and in 2023 a restaurant will be added. Adventure golf takes classic golf fields with their natural obstacles and turns them into 18 minigolf sized tracks. It's a calm, beautiful and free-spirited place with organic shapes and a lot of greenery. The restaurant will offer a Bar & Grill menu mainly with hamburgers. The interior design should aslo have a natural and very friendly feel. 
My proposal to the young owners was to also create the social media and marketing strategy. The technique I chose for marketing is called gamification. A discipline derived from video games that uses the principles of human curiosity and competitvnes. The visual identity can be described as very round, (gently) colorful and friendly. Since the target audience are not only adults wanting to relax, but also families with children. 

keywords: adventure golf, design, gamification, visual identity

#### 3rd draft
This bachelor thesis is about creating a complex visual and communication style for the sports and recreational facility Bar & Grill Adventure Golf Kamencov√© jezero. This is a real project, with construction taking place from summer 2022 to May 2023. An important part of this is the design of the social media marketing strategy, along with an explanation for the owners, who will manage the content on all platforms themselves.
Adventure golf is a special kind of minigolf. Aesthetically reminiscent of a park, the course occupies the first half of the project, a restaurant stands in the second half. This is the only adventure golf course in Chomutov and the surrounding area. The entire resulting visual style is based on theory focused on the rules of visual identity, graphic design, marketing principles and gamification principles.
