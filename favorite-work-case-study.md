__A. Challenge__ 

Memisto is a newly created brand. The goal is to get statement, high quality furniture to modern households/apartments. 

Thankfully my client did his research. He found out, that people who could afford such homes, would prefer professionals to arrange said space. That is why our end customer is most likely to be an interior designer = B2B communication. 

My assignment was to create the:
- brand name 
- moodboard 
- logo 
- color palette 
- pattern 
- e commerce preview 
- Instagram templates 

&nbsp;

__B. Solution__ 

After researching the competition, inspiration and foreign brands I made a project proposal. 

We'll create a name that subtly plays with words but is easy to pronounce (in eng/cz). Something funky but memorable. Most of the furniture my client would like to sell looks very round and soft. We will enhance that with light and calming colours. To add some contrast and character, I'll add sharper shapes and patterns. Here I'd like to remind you, that we are already targeting designers! The outcome can look more expensive and little bit out of reach. E commerce needs to be very easy to navigate. Socials should feel very timeless, not too trendy, but still active. 

Key words: timeless, statement, clouds, cosy

__C. Result__ 

Memisto in czech, when broken apart, means "m√© m√≠sto" = "my place". You can see it, but it's not too obvious. (This took much longer than expected, since I had nothing from the client to hold onto). Other ideas were for example Mialgo, Tonas or Kalma.. After checking .com availability and memorability, Memisto was the winner. 

The typography was very easy to choose, since we knew from the beginning the vibe it should have. Logo and the 3 dots came naturally‚Ä¶ The feel of wanting more, of something unsaid. Straight up our alley! 

Than we have the checker board. Chess is one of the oldest and most sophisticated games I can think of. But changing the black to a muted brown makes all the difference. And when I added the round, beautiful, sometimes pastel furniture, it all made sense. 

E commerce has a blend of beauty and simplicity (cheesy, right?). But that's all we need, let the products speak for themselves. No games, no fuss. 

This project is still in progres and I can't wait to share the final results!

It's been one of the most beautiful and relaxing branding rides I've been on. These are the projects that fuel my creativity and will to keep working.
