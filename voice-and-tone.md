### Voice 
To me, voice feels very natural, it's who I am. I believe it can be changed, but it would be challenge. Maybe I can care for it? Give it some sort of direction, guidelines, carefully watch it? And look for possible mistakes. My core values are honesty, truth, warmth, respect and friendliness. The audience I'm trying to attract is younger (25-40 y. o.). Generally interested in design or aesthetics. 

### Tone
Tone is something I choose, it's variable, the flavour to my voice, the song I decide to sing. I'm very particular about getting along with my clients (and friends). The indicator is usually the way they we critique and give opinions. I intend to express myself in a kind and honest way. When I'm about to say something negative, I always avoid being rude and instead use politeness. That's not to be confused with sugar coating. When it's possible and welcomed I like to lighten up the mood with something funny and light. 

### Client
In two words - mutual respect. The best example is the "negative comment" approach. Since my clients have to review my work and give feedback.. "always avoid being rude and instead use politeness. That's not to be confused with sugar coating."
- my dream client: small and/or personal business, preferably local projects, I tend to have a very personal approach - getting along with my client is essential
- ideal projects: branding, logo manuals, visual identity, design drafts and brand brainstorming
