# 7. Thesis abstract & presentation

### Abstract
I dedicated my thesis to the visual identity for Adventure Golf Kamencov√© jezero in Chomutov. The minigolf-like playground was built in 2022 and in 2023 a restaurant will be added. Adventure golf takes classic golf fields with their natural obstacles and turns them into 18 minigolf sized tracks. It's a calm, beautiful and free-spirited place with organic shapes and a lot of greenery. The restaurant will offer a Bar & Grill menu mainly with hamburgers. The interior design should aslo have a natural and very friendly feel. 

My proposal to the young owners was to also create the social media and marketing strategy. The technique I chose for marketing is called gamification. A discipline derived from video games that uses the principles of human curiosity and competitvnes. The visual identity can be described as very round, (gently) colorful and friendly. Since the target audience are not only adults wanting to relax, but also families with children. 

key words: adventure golf, design, gamification, visual identity
