## Abstract

### 1st draft

This bachelor’s thesis deals with the creation of a complex identity for the sports and recreational facility Bar & Grill Adventure Golf Kamencové jezero. An important part of this is the design of a social media marketing strategy along with a manual for the owners who wish to manage their content across all platforms themselves. The adventure golf playground was built in 2022 on the site of a former mini golf course, it should be noted that they are not the same discipline. This fact needs to be explained and emphasized through the visual identity not only to the readers of this work, but also to the residents of Chomutov (where the complex is located) and other potential visitors.

### 2nd draft

I dedicated my thesis to the visual identity for Adventure Golf Kamencové jezero in Chomutov. The minigolf-like playground was built in 2022 and in 2023 a restaurant will be added. Adventure golf takes classic golf fields with their natural obstacles and turns them into 18 minigolf sized tracks. It’s a calm, beautiful and free-spirited place with organic shapes and a lot of greenery. The restaurant will offer a Bar & Grill menu mainly with hamburgers. The interior design should aslo have a natural and very friendly feel. My proposal to the young owners was to also create the social media and marketing strategy. The technique I chose for marketing is called gamification. A discipline derived from video games that uses the principles of human curiosity and competitvnes. The visual identity can be described as very round, (gently) colorful and friendly. Since the target audience are not only adults wanting to relax, but also families with children.

### 3rd draft

This bachelor thesis is about creating a complex visual and communication style for the sports and recreational facility Bar & Grill Adventure Golf Kamencové jezero. This is a real project, with construction taking place from summer 2022 to May 2023. An important part of this is the design of the social media marketing strategy, along with an explanation for the owners, who will manage the content on all platforms themselves. Adventure golf is a special kind of minigolf. Aesthetically reminiscent of a park, the course occupies the first half of the project, a restaurant stands in the second half. This is the only adventure golf course in Chomutov and the surrounding area. The entire resulting visual style is based on theory focused on the rules of visual identity, graphic design, marketing principles and gamification principles.
