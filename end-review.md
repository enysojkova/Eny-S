# 9. Year end review

> 1) What did you like most about this course?

A: I enjoyed the homeworks and presentations with your feedback, that always helped me see new things to improve. I mean, I don't usually enjoy homeworks, but the work you gave us was challenging and you showed us new techniques to approach the problem. Most of the advice you gave us stuck with me and I continue practicing it.  


&nbsp;

> 2) What did you like least about this course? 

A: I would prefer a more communicative group, where I might have built up more courage to speak and say my opinion.

&nbsp;

> 3) What were the top (three) things you learned this year?

A: The course taught me a lot about written english and different, more open and authentic ways to express myself. 
I loved learning _Github!!!_ 
And all the tools you showed us such as the color contrast checker and Hemingway. 

&nbsp;

> 4) What was the most memorable activity/assignment?

A: The storytelling presentation, because I chose a very personal topic and was proud of the outcome. I aso started applying the tips I came up with in my own design process and life approach. My learning process has also changed ever since. 

&nbsp;

> 5) What’s something you accomplished this year that you are most proud of?

A: I learned to use Github (great accomplishment for me, yes), and I finished my thesis and on my way to become a Bc. I also planned a spontaneous skiing trip in Austria with my friend. And we survived

&nbsp;

> 6) What’s one thing you learned about yourself?

A: My time managment is even worse than I thought. I have so many free hours that could be used in a better way. 

&nbsp;

> 7) What’s one thing you could have done better?

A: Ask every question that went through my head when in doubt. I also should have (as already mentioned) used my time more carefuly and actively. 

&nbsp;

> 8) What’s one thing I could have done better?

A: We could've done more work on our projects in class, so you would see our progress right away a we could've consulted with other students. I know we can do that anyway, but if it were part of the class, we could've gotten more used to it and the outcome wouldn't be such a surprise to everyone. 

&nbsp;

> 9) What’s one thing you would add or change about this course?

A: Nothiiiing.

&nbsp;

> 10) What advice would you give to students taking this course next year?

A: Enjoy it and don't miss a single class, I did and I regret it.
