#### Art school - 2006-20
I joined "ZU≈† Chomutov" at the age of 6 to study art education. Here I had the opportunity to try many artistic techniques from ceramics to lithography. Theory was also part of the teaching - perspective, golden ratio, drawing from angles. 

&nbsp;

#### University V≈†KK (cz), PSCC (eng) - 2020-23
At the Prague School of Creative Communication I was taught by professionals in the field. The main subjects were, for example, history of art and design, typography or also marketing and philosophy. The school connected us with many interesting clients and commissions (Czech Post, Kobe Restaurants or the town of ≈†pindler≈Øv ml√Ωn).

&nbsp;

#### Kobe Gastro Group - 2021-22
The cooperation with Kobe was facilitated by the school. Kobe Restaurants approached the university to rebrand their existing restaurants and create a new company, Kobe Gastro Group. Kobe GG will be the parent company that will be the umbrella for their 4 restaurants. It will also be used for day to day communication with clients and suppliers. 


10 teams created proposals that were judged in 2 rounds. Our team made it to the finals and ended up winning first place and continues to work with the client. 


Our work included 2 facelifts of existing logos. 2 designs for new logos and communication styles. The last one was brand manuals. 


My role in this project: team leader, sketches of all facelifts and new logos.

&nbsp;

#### PAVA Dental Lab - 2022
It's important to emphasize that this is not a dental practice, but only a laboratory that supplies dentists with implants, etc. 

My job was to create a logo and design the application on business cards and t-shirts. 

&nbsp;

#### Customised by Ji≈ô√≠ Dvo≈ô√°ƒçek - 2022
The client makes his own watch straps and wallets from genuine leather. He processes the leather himself and stamps his logo on the products - which I designed and processed. 

&nbsp;

#### Kimono design - 2022
2 Complete designs of names and sponsors on the back and their logo on the front. For 2 young athletes (Brazilian jiu-jitsu) performing at world level. 

&nbsp;

#### Nahota ≈æivota (transl. The Nudity of Life) - 2022-23
2nd collection of my dear friend's poems. My job is to create the cover and design the layout of the text in the book, choosing the fonts and creating additional illustrations. 

&nbsp;

#### Memisto - 2022-23
Memisto is an online shop offering luxury furniture from Europe. Lamps, chandeliers, armchairs, chairs, writing and dining tables, coffee tables or storage furniture. My task was to come up with a name in addition to the usual branding (logo, pattern, font, colours). I also designed the look of the website and the design for social media communication. 

&nbsp;

#### Lior - 2023
Czech manufacturer of luminaires with a wide range of chromaticity and the possibility of changing RGB colours. The main idea is healthy, smart lighting. Due to the exceptional design and high price this project is very interesting. 
Due to time pressure I was forced to part with the project in the middle. This means that my part only included creating the name, moodboard and designing the communication. However, the owners continue to work with some of my designs and ideas.
